Between its two front feet is what appears to be some small creature with eyes that excessively blink and a rounded mouth. It is unknown what this creature is, as it is never mentioned in flavor text or by any Froggits.\r\n\r\nPersonality\r\nFroggit is overall a weak monster, attempting to run away from the protagonist when at low health, shivering when threatened and leaving after Toriel glares at it for attacking the protagonist. It is influenced easily by the protagonist's comments, despite not being able to understand them. However, it is also somewhat informed, telling the protagonist about functions in the game and foreshadowing sparing techniques.",

Its body shape resembles that of a ghost. Its facial expression is sad, with an open frowning mouth, and two mostly-closed eyes with dots under them.\r\n\r\nPersonality\r\nWhimsun is extremely sensitive, as suggested by its flavor text. It runs away if the protagonist consoles it and is terrorized by a small finger wiggle. It can be spared immediately and is extremely apologetic.

Ebott tarot card.\r\n\r\nPersonality\r\nMoldsmal does not actually say anything in its dialogue; it only makes noises comparable to a slime. In its Check, Moldsmal is described as being \"Curvaceously attractive, but [with] no brains.\" In its flavor text, Moldsmal acts patient and pensive, as it is willing to rest on the floor for a while and is described as ruminating.",
